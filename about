Change Management Data Analysis
This project analyzes synthetic change request data typically used in PMO (Project Management Office) or Change Management roles. It focuses on how long each change took to complete, uncovering bottlenecks and trends that could help optimize operational efficiency.

Objective
To demonstrate data analysis skills by exploring:
The time taken to complete each change request
The distribution of change durations
Differences in duration by change type (if available)

Skills Applied
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing using Pandas
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Seaborn/Matplotlib
Working with date columns and durations
Generating summary tables and insights
Communicating findings with visualizations

Files
File Name	Description
change_analysis.ipynb	Jupyter Notebook with full analysis and charts
change_request_data.csv	Synthetic dataset used for the analysis

Key Insights
Calculated the number of days taken to complete each change
Identified changes that took the longest
Visualized how change durations vary across requests
Created a clean summary table of top 10 longest changes

About the Dataset
The dataset is synthetic and created for learning purposes, inspired by real-world PMO workflows. It contains:
Change_ID
Requested_Date
Completed_Date
Change_Type, Department, etc.

Why This Project
I'm transitioning from a Change Management / PMO background into Data Analytics.

This project combines my domain knowledge with my data science skills to:
Show real-world business impact
Communicate data clearly
Practice hands-on analysis
